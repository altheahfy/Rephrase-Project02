Existential There Engine Integration Test

Tests the integration of Priority 16 ExistentialThereEngine with Grammar Master Controller v2.
Verifies proper engine selection, slot extraction, and processing for existential there constructions.

Coverage: 
- Basic existence: There is/are + NP + (PP)
- Modal existence: There will/can/must be + NP + (PP)  
- Perfect existence: There has/have been + NP + (PP)
- Negative existence: There isn't/aren't + NP + (PP)
- Complex modifiers: Time and location phrases
